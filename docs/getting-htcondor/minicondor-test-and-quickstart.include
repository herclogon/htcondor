.. rubric:: Verifying a Single-Machine Installation

You can easily check to see if the installation procedure succeeded.  The
following commands should complete without errors, producing output that
looks like the corresponding example.

.. code-block:: shell

    condor_status

.. code-block:: console

If both commands worked, the installation likely succeeded.
