Running Ornithology Tests

    To run the Ornithology tests, you must be using Python 3 and have the
Python 3 HTCondor/ClassAd libraries in your PYTHONPATH.  Assuming you set
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX to ~/install, after 'make install' finishes, you'll
set PYTHONPATH to ~/install/lib/python3.  Make sure that your installed
bin/ directory is in your PATH (before any system version of HTCondor),
and that CONDOR_CONFIG points to HTCondor under test.*

    You'll need PyTest and one extension to run the Ornithology tests.  The
easiest way to handle this is with Pip, although you can use your system
PyTest (and pytest-httpserver) if you desire:

$ cd condor_tests
$ pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt

    This may install a 'pytest' executable early enough in your PATH to be
useful, but assuming it doesn't, you can start a specific Ornithology test
in the following way:

$ python3 -m pytest test_run_sleep_job.py

    One of the early lines in the output will look like the following:

Base per-test directory: /tmp/condor-tests-1598380839-15666

which will not be cleaned up after the test runs, for your debugging
convenience.

*: This may require as little as setting RELEASE_DIR properly.
