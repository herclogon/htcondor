# HTCondor

[HTCondor](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/) is a
[Distributed High Throughput Computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-throughput_computing)
system developed at the
[Center for High Throughput Computing](http://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/)
at the University of Wisconsin - Madison.  With it, users can divide large
computing workloads into jobs and submit them to an HTCondor scheduler,
which will run them on worker nodes managed by HTCondor.

Prebuilt binaries for Linux, Windows and Mac can be
[downloaded.](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/downloads/)

# Documentation

The [HTCondor manual](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/manual/) is a

# Community

The CHTC maintains active [email lists](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/mail-lists/)
where the HTCondor community asks and answers questions about the installation,
use, or tuning of HTCondor.  If you have a question, encounter a surprise about
HTCondor, or a potential bug, these public email lists are the first place to go.

We welcome github pull requests for code fixes or documentation improvements, but if
you have ideas for a big feature change, please talk with us first.

is our annual community meeting in Madison, WI, and we often have an annual
meeting in Europe as well. We encourage everyone with an interest in HTCondor
to join us.
